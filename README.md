## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERFORMANCE

Due to reliance on browser-based loading, you may encounter the following during the initial startup:

* **Initial Loading Delay:** The loader may sometimes appear stuck or take a few extra moments to resolve.
* **Asset Loading:** Animated elements (like the .gif logo) might occasionally fail to load or take time depending on network conditions and browser capability.

Please use a modern browser and a computer with good specifications to ensure the smoothest and intended user experience.
